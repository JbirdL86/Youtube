# Youtube-Project

> This is a Youtube copy project for microverse students. We've implemented responsivness to the page and it has help us to learn lot of HTML and basic CSS. On the top of the page you will find a navigation var that will scroll with the page, this was thanks to the position fixed property. As the main content you can find an iframe which holds the video player, the resposiveness of the video was achivable thanks to the position relative and absolute properties. Also, on the same flex column you'll find the comments. Finally but not least, you will see a playlist on the right, this was the other column of the main flex container. You can find the basic structure model on this link: https://app.lucidchart.com/documents/view/540f5686-66cc-4334-a18f-0fd01c9a2caf/fLIdogm_myHX
